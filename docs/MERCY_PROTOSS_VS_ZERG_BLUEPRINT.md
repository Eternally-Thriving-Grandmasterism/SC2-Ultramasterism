Mercy PvZ = infinite golden harmony vs infinite swarm rebirth — valence-synced mutual thriving ladder resonance.

## Phase 1 – Early (0:00–4:00)
- Opener: 19 Nexus → 1 Gate → Cyber → Robo → Twilight → Stargate
- Mercy response to cheese: Battery + Adept vs 12-pool, MSC + 1 Gate vs proxy Hatch
- Goal: 50–55 probes, 3rd Nexus by 3:45, Robo + Twilight by 4:30

## Phase 2 – Mid (4:00–7:30)
- Tech: Robo → Twilight → Disruptor Den → Archon + Storm
- Mercy timings: 5:30 Immortal + Adept deny, 6:30 Disruptor zone, Oracle + Adept shade deny mining
- Defense: Shield Battery + Storm + Disruptor hold
- Goal: 70–80 probes, 5–6 bases, Carrier/Tempest research ~7:00

## Phase 3 – Late (7:30+)
- Critical mass: 8+ Carriers + 4+ Tempests + Storm + Disruptor + Archon
- Mercy kill: Tempest volley + Storm + Disruptor + Graviton = army delete <30s
- Nydus counter + Tempest + Storm drop vs turtle = surgical base wipe
- Signature timing: 9:00–10:30 Carrier + Tempest spike

## Mercy Commandments
- Micro Mercy: Zone, never target drones

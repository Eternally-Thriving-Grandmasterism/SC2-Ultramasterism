# Disruptor Nova Micro Techniques

Disruptor (purification nova: 145+55 shield damage, 8s cooldown) = deathball apex melter. Advanced micro maximizes hits: ball placement, nova baiting, connectivity control. Hotkey eternal: Disruptors separate on 6-7.

### 1. Nova Ball Placement & Connectivity (Positioning Apex)![](grok_render_searched_image_card_json={"cards":[{"cardId":"3d7836","imageId":"0","size":"LARGE"},{"cardId":"557ddc","imageId":"2","size":"LARGE"},{"cardId":"2a2ed9","imageId":"4","size":"LARGE"}]})

- Convex arc formation: Curve Disruptors forward → overlapping nova radii without self-hits.
- Cliff/high ground park: Nova drops downhill (no enemy pathing needed).
- Bait connectivity: Queue nova on bait units (e.g., partial Prism unload) → chain real targets mid-ball.

### 2. Nova Drop Timing & Bait Micro (The "Blast Dance" Apex)
- Pre-drop stutter: Move-queue balls into clumps mid-engagement.
- Manual nova priority: Click nova on low-HP/clumped (e.g., charged Zealots).
- Overload bait: Fake drops on ghosts → waste opponent splits, connect real nova.

### 3. Multi-Ball Split & Utility Combo
- Split 4-8 Disruptors: One ball baits front, others flank nova.
- Phoenix lift/Oracle stasis: Isolate clumps pre-nova.
- Prism warp synergy: Phase fields behind → warp Chargelots into nova'd survivors.

Lattice Tie-In: In our rematch sim, bait phasing + lift/stasis wasted AlphaStar novas — probe kills 52 eternal. Human prediction > optimized timing.

Practice: Replay parser for "nova hit efficiency" metric.

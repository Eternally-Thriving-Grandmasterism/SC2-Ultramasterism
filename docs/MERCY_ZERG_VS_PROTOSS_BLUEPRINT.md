- Opener: 17 Hatch → 18 Gas → 17 Pool → 20 Overlord → 3rd Hatch ~3:30
- Mercy response to cheese: 12–14 Pool + Spine vs proxy/cannon, ling speed vs 4-gate
- Goal: 50–55 drones, 4th Hatch by 4:30, Lair ~4:45

- Goal: 70–80 drones, 5–6 bases, Ultralisk Den research ~7:00

## Phase 3 – Late (7:30+)
- Critical mass: 10+ Ultralisks + 6+ Vipers + Corruptor + Lurker
- Mercy kill: Blinding cloud + Fungal + Lurker volley = army delete <30s
- Nydus + Ultralisk drop vs turtle = surgical base wipe
- Signature timing: 9:00–10:30 Ultralisk + Viper spike

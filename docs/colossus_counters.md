# Colossus Counter Strategies

Colossus (thermal lance cliffs, 150 DPS splash) = ground melt king. Counters punish range/slow turn: air switches, abducts, micro splits.![](grok_render_searched_image_card_json={"cards":[{"cardId":"74c17c","imageId":"6","size":"LARGE"},{"cardId":"865aae","imageId":"7","size":"LARGE"},{"cardId":"a9eef9","imageId":"8","size":"LARGE"}]})

### 1. Positioning Punish (Cliff Abuse & Denial)
- Force low ground: Phoenix graviton lift off cliffs.
- Viking/Corruptor air switch: Snipe isolated Colossus.

### 2. Abduct & Burst Counters
- Viper abduct: Yoink into swarm/EMP.
- Blink Stalker/Zealot charge: Flank legs under range.

### 3. Multi-Prong Overload vs Colossus Lines
- Prism drops behind: Warp Archons/Immortals into blind spots.
- Storm/Feedback: HT psi storm lances or Feedback energy.

Pure Truth: Utility overload (lift/abduct/stasis) > static lance zoning. AlphaStar Colossus lines mercy-reconciled by split harass eternal.
